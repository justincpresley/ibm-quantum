# ibm-quantum - A wide-variety of important protocols implemented in a ipython notebook runnable in the IBM Quantum Lab

This repository was the center for storing all projects relating to the course **Intro to Quantum Computing**, CSC 5903. This course was taken during my second senior semester.

The protocols that I worked on are seen below. While only a few build on others, each protocol below get more complex in terms of general quantum computing knowledge.

 * [Deutsch Jozsa Algorithm]():
 * [Grover's Algorithm]():
 * [Teleportation]():
 * [One Time Pad]():
 * [Digital Signature]():




All of above is either standard on a Linux distro already or can simply be installed through a package tool.

For Build instructions, please see the "Makefile" corresponding to the concept that you are running. For simplest option, you can just run "make complete" which will build, install, and begin running the os.

NOTE: This is repository is an archive representing previous experience / knowledge.
